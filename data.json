        "2": "The experimental approach of progressively reducing central blood volume to the point of hemodynamic decompensation with the use of lower body negative pressure has revealed stark distinctions in the physiological compensatory responses between individuals with high compared with low tolerances to blood loss.",
        "3": "High tolerance to hemorrhage is defined by a capacity to maintain systemic perfusion pressure and reduce the rate of cerebral hypoperfusion by: (1) protecting cardiac output with greater elevations in heart rate associated with greater cardiac vagal withdrawal and sympathetically mediated adrenergic stimulation; (2) greater increases in systemic peripheral vascular resistance associated with higher sympathetic nerve activation and levels of circulating vasopressor endocrine responses; (3) alternating blood flow between the brain and peripheral tissue with greater sympathetically mediated oscillatory patterns of systemic pressure and flow; and (4) enhancing cardiac filling and cerebral perfusion pressure gradient by optimizing the respiratory pump.",
        "4": "When the capacity for these compensatory responses is exhausted, an active vasodilation drops resistance to blood flow allowing for increased perfusion of peripheral tissue.",

This test approach has shown differences in the bodily responses between individuals with high tolerances versus low tolerances to blood loss.",
          "3": "High tolerance to hemorrhage is defined by maintaining body wide blood flow pressure and prevent decreased brain blood pressure. This is done by one of four ways.  First, by protecting cardiac output with greater elevations in heart rate associated with greater cardiac vagal withdrawal and sympathetically mediated adrenergic stimulation. Second, a greater increases in systemic peripheral vascular resistance (blood vessel resistance) associated with higher sympathetic nerve activation (fight-or-flight reaction) and levels of circulating vasopressor endocrine responses (responses from chemical messengers). Third, an alternating blood flow between the brain and peripheral tissue with greater sympathetically mediated oscillatory patterns of systemic pressure and flow. Lastly, by enhancing cardiac filling and cerebral perfusion pressure gradient (pressure driving oxygen to brain tissue) by optimizing the respiratory pump (muscles that help the lung extract and contract).",

          "4": "Results showed that alpha-thalassemia protected SCA patients from cerebral vasculopathy (diseases of blood vessels in the brain). But, it increased the risk for more painful crises due to blood vessel blockages.",
          "5": "We also showed that more HbF-QTL may protect more against cerebral vasculopathy, but only for children with certain genetic types of alpha-thalassemia."
